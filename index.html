        Hi, I'm Castiel or Bug in a Tub. I'm an EWU student majoring in Visual Communication Design with a certificate in Animation. My passions lie in art, animation, and books. A bit of a mixed bag with the arts, I enjoy drawing, writing, and 3D modeling.<br>My goals currently are graduating and find a job in either Graphic Design or 3D modeling while working on my personal web comic project. My longterm goal is to one day become a published author.</p>

           <h6>Important and Key Experiences</h6>
          <br>
          <p><i>Identify two important learning experiences and/or "a-ha" moments you had during this class.</i><br><Br>
            1. Seeing how flexbox works and how useful it is.<br><br>
            2. Not everyone knows basic html and css. I genuinely thought it was something common, but I think it's just because I'm older and grew up around basic coding back in the early 2000s.
            <br><br><br>
          </p>
           <h6>What do you know now that you didn't know in January</h6>
          <br>
          <p><i>Write a few brief phrases or sentences regarding what you learned, why it is/was important to you and what the outcome was.</i>
            <br><br>
            I learned how to use flexbox and how useful it is to allow seamless refitting based on what is being used to view the site. I'm still very used to old school position stuff since I'm mainly a pc user, so I've realized that you must code for various different sized viewing.
            <br><br><br>
          </p>
           <h6>Change and Growth</h6>
          <br>
          <p><i>Describe 3 experiences when you learned something that changed how you thought about: thinking, design, education, and learning</i>
            
            <br><br>1. Coding an actual webpage versus a petpage on a petite is vastly different so having to account for new things such as an overall nav bar and no extra information to format around (pet stats, pet minion etc).<Br><br>
            2. Media queries. I'm heavily a pc user only (3 monitors) so I don't ever think or care about mobile/tablet versions (I rarely use my phone except for when I'm at work or class and the tablet I have is just for drawing on the go) so mobile/tablet design is never in my mind at all.<br><br>
            3. Site design is very different from how it used to be years ago and most sites are basic and straight to the point with the landing page being a tagline text and clean white background. Texture seems to not be something that's seen anymore or heavy use of decorative things just as frames and little bullets.
            <br><br><br>
          </p>
           <h6>What work was challenging?</h6>
          <br>
          <p>I got very bored while doing it. I like coding, but I get bored very easily and starting to think I have undiagnosed ADHD with all the concentration issues I'm only starting to notice since I started college again.</p>
          
          <h6>General Feedback</h6>
          <br>
          <p><i>What worked?</i><br>
            I really liked the freeCodeCamp. It was a good refresher for coding in general and learning new things such as using flexbox and grid layout.
            <br><br>
            <i>What didn't work?</i><br>
            Having to follow like specific naming conventions for boxes and containers.
            <br><br>
          </p>

          
        <h6>Connections</h6>
          <p>
          <br>
            <i>Did you ever talk about this outside of class?</i><br>I'd talk about it to my Fianc√© and my online friend whom has a newer phone model for me and it's always helpful to have a second opinion from an outsider on a design.<br>
            
            <br><i>Did you become curious about anything new?</i><br>Not really besides just wanting to learn Javascript. I wanted to integrate it into my final, but haven't found an use for it in my final portfolio project<Br>
            
            <br><i>Did this class connect with any other courses?</i><br>Typography<br>
            <br><i>Did you make any new friends?</i><br>No
          </p>
          <Br><br>
           <h6>A Penny for Your Thoughts</h6>
          <br>
          <p><i>What was fun?</i><br>
            I enjoyed the freeCodeCamp lessons such as building a penguin. 
            <br><br>
            What was useful?<br>
            freeCodeCamp and codepen. Gone are the days of typing in a code and hitting submit and going back to change something by 2px.
            <br><br>
            <i>What is one random fact that you learned this quarter?</i><br> There are sites like Github and Netlify that allow for easy deployment of coding between the two without needing your own domain.
            <br><br>
            <i>What's a profound insight you have gained?</i><br>
            There's lots of resources for easily accessing and learning code and deploying it.
